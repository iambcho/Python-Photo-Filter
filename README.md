# Python-Photo-Filter
This program is a photo filter that asks the user for a file path to the image to be filtered. The program can execute the following filters: grayscale, pixelate, flip (the image), and tetris. The program can execute one or several filters on one image simultaneously.

## Getting Started

To run this program, you will need to use python 2.7 for the PIL module. You must install the PIL module. Also please run this on PyCharm or another integrated development environment. Then, all you need to do is download insta.py and image_utils.py and have an image that you would like to filter (within the same folder as insta.py).
