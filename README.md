# Python-Photo-Filter
This program is a photo filter that asks the user for a file path to the image to be filtered. The program can execute the following filters: grayscale, pixelate, kaleidoscope, flip (the image), and tetris. The program can execute one or several filters on one image simultaneously.

## Getting Started

To run this program, execute "pip install image-utils". Then, all you need to do is download insta.py and have an image that you would like to filter.
